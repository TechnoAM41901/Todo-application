Test the API using Postman, cURL, or a browser:

GET /todos – Fetch all to-dos.
POST /todos – Add a new to-do (send JSON in the request body).
PUT /todos/:id – Mark a specific to-do as completed.
DELETE /todos/:id – Delete a specific to-do.



Testing the Changes:
After applying these changes, you can test the routes:

1. POST /todos (Add Todo):

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/todos -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"task": "Buy groceries"}'

If successful, you'll receive a 201 Created response with the new todo.

If the task is missing:


curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/todos -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'

You'll receive a 400 Bad Request with the error {"error": "Task is required"}.




2. GET /todos (Get All Todos):

curl http://localhost:3000/todos
If successful, you'll get a JSON array of all the todos.



3. PUT /todos/:id (Complete Todo):

curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/todos/1

If the id exists, the todo will be marked as completed. If it doesn’t, you'll get a 404 Not Found with the message {"error": "Todo not found"}.




4. DELETE /todos/:id (Delete Todo):

curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/todos/1


If the id exists, the todo will be deleted. If not, you'll receive a 404 Not Found with the message {"error": "Todo not found"}.
